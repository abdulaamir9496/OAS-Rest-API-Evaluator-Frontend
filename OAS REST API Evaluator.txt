Earlier The Problems were:

1. Your app is trying to make requests to the API endpoints (like http://localhost:5173/v2/pet/{petId}/uploadImage) directly
2. The Swagger/OpenAPI URLs (like PetStore) are external APIs, not hosted on your localhost
3. You're getting network errors because the paths need to be properly resolved to their full URLs
****************************************************************
What Changes Were Made :

In testExecutor.ts:

Added proper URL resolution by extracting the base URL from the endpoint path
Added handling for path parameters (replacing {parameter} placeholders with actual values)
Added support for all HTTP methods (PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
Made saving test results to the backend optional (won't fail tests if backend server isn't running)
Added a helper function to generate sensible dummy values for path parameters

In openApiParser.ts:

Added proper URL resolution by combining the server URL from the spec with the path
Ensures all endpoints have the full URL including the base URL

Additional Notes

CORS Issues: You might encounter CORS issues when making requests to external APIs directly from your browser. In a production environment, you'd typically route these requests through your backend to avoid CORS problems.
Backend API Server: The code attempts to save test results to your backend server at https://oas-rest-api-evaluator-backend.onrender.com/api/test-results. Make sure this server is running, or the test will continue without saving results.
Path Parameters: The code now replaces path parameters with dummy values based on parameter names. You might want to customize the generatePathParamValue function for more specific requirements.

How to Implement These Changes

1. Replace your current testExecutor.ts with the updated version
2. Update or create your openApiParser.ts with the provided version
3. Make sure your API backend is running at https://oas-rest-api-evaluator-backend.onrender.com or update the API_URL constant in the code

These changes should fix the network errors you're experiencing by ensuring the API requests are made to the correct URL.

For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Key Improvements:

Better Server URL Handling:

Now correctly extracts server URLs from both OpenAPI 3.0 and Swagger 2.0 formats
Handles servers array in OpenAPI 3.0 and scheme/host/basePath in Swagger 2.0
Removes trailing slashes for consistency


Metadata Extraction:

Added extraction of API metadata (title, version, description)
This provides more context in the returned endpoint objects


Comprehensive HTTP Method Support:

Now supports all standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD)
Previous version only supported GET and POST


Improved Parameter Handling:

Correctly combines path-level and operation-level parameters
This ensures all applicable parameters are included for each endpoint


Enhanced Error Handling:

Maintained the try/catch structure for robust error reporting
Added detailed error messages


Better Default Values:

Added sensible defaults for operationId and summary
Added support for tags and deprecated flag


Consistent Endpoint Object Structure:

Standardized the endpoint object to include the same fields regardless of OpenAPI version
Added additional useful fields like description and tags


The updated parser now handles both OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0 specifications more robustly and returns more comprehensive endpoint information. This should make it much easier to work with different API specifications in your application.
